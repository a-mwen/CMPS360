<p>The Kansas City Chiefs are world champions once again following their thrilling victory in Super Bowl LVIII.</p>

<h2>Quick Notes from the Win:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>The Chiefs are in the midst of one of the greatest runs of sustained success in NFL history.</li>
    <li>Kansas City secured its third Super Bowl victory in five seasons on Sunday, marking just the fifth time in the Super Bowl Era that a team has won three titles in five years. Kansas City joined the 1974-78 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 1992-95 Dallas Cowboys, the 2001-04 New England Patriots and the 2014-18 Patriots as the only teams to achieve that feat.</li>
    <li>The Chiefs are just the ninth team in league history to repeat as Super Bowl champions, and the first since New England did so 19 years ago.</li>
    <li>Kansas City overcame a 10-point deficit in all three of its Super Bowl victories.</li>
